E-Commerce Website CodWave Task

**Task Overview:**
The objective of this project was to develop an e-commerce website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a focus on creating a responsive design for four different screen sizes (1200px, 992px, 768px, and 567px). Below, I will provide an overview of the key features and components of the website.

**Key Features:**

1. **Navbar:** The website features a responsive navbar containing icons for the shopping bag, the number of items in the bag, and a wishlist icon.

2. **Home Page:** The home page showcases a selection of products and a section for displaying top-rated products to engage users.

3. **Product Description:** Users can click on a product to view its detailed description by passing its unique ID. This feature ensures that users can learn more about a specific product.

4. **Similar Items Section:** After viewing a product's description, users are presented with a section that utilizes the Swiper.js library to display similar items, enhancing the user's shopping experience.

5. **Shopping Bag:** Users can access their shopping bag to view items they have added. The shopping bag allows users to increment or decrement the quantity of items and remove items. The total price dynamically updates with each change. Notably, users cannot increase the number of items less than 1, ensuring data consistency.

6. **Product Store:** The product store section lists various products and provides filtering options. Users can add items to their wishlist and shopping bag directly from this section. Filters include price range (min and max) and color.

**Technical Details:**

- **Local Storage:** Local storage is used to store items in the user's bag, ensuring that added items persist across sessions.

- **Duplicate Prevention:** The system prevents users from adding the same item to their bag more than once.

- **Wishlist Management:** Users can remove items from their wishlist either by clicking the remove icon or using the "Remove" button within the wishlist card.

**Conclusion:**
The e-commerce website successfully achieves its objectives by providing a responsive design, a seamless shopping experience, and essential features such as product descriptions, shopping bag management, and product filtering. The use of local storage enhances user experience by preserving added items. Notably, the system enforces a rule where users cannot increase the number of items less than 1, ensuring data integrity and a better user experience. The project is available for review and further development in the GitHub repository.
